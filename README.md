Hey, you! Yeah you!  

Are you tired of all the same old boring
Chrome new tab pages with clocks and weather forecasts?  

Are you looking for a way to express your individuality  
while letting the world know of your obsession with brutalist architecture?

Are you barely able to see your computer screen over  
the massive piles of _Bernie 2016_ merchandise you own?

Well then this is the Chrome extension for you!

## What the hell _is_ it?

The Worker's Clock is the ultimate Chrome new tab page.  
Based on Robert Owen's [Eight Hour Day Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day),
this page displays the time to you converted into three eight hour periods (much better than the lame twelve hour time):

* RT: Rest Time (Midnight to 8 AM)
* LT: Labor Time (8 AM to 4 PM)
* RC: Recreation Time (4 PM to Midnight)

## Wait, _what_?

Just try it, you'll love it, trust me!
